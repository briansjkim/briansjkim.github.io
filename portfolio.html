                <p>For those to play fantasy basketball, before going into your league's draft, we would create a list
                  of players who we want to draft. These players would be an even spread of superstars or solid players
                  who would help us grab the number one spot!<strong> However, </strong> as the draft proceeds, we see
                  our desired players being taken by our friends/opponents.<br /><br /> In order to fix this, I created
                  a fantasy basketball app so that users can create their dream team without any interruptions. With
                  this app, you can easily add any player you like. If you change your mind, you can drop them from your
                  team and see that player added back to the available players list. If, for some reason, a player gets
                  traded right before the draft, you can update the team that they player along with deleting that
                  player from the list if they retire.</p>
                <p>A technical issue that I ran into was having each player be removed from the available players list
                  and added to the team list quickly. I had initially used MongoDB as my database; however, after
                  multiple attempts at optimization, there was still a very slight lag in rendering. So, I migrated
                  databases from MongoDB to PostgreSQL and optimized it through PostgreSQL tuning and vertical
                  partitioning. Not only did this speed up the rendering time, but it also reduced my query times by
                  about 10ms.</p>

                  millions of users and data</p>
                <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="https://bkportfolio.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/sdc.png"
                  alt="">
                <p>I was given a legacy codebase with a database that only held 100 products and was required to scale
                  the database in order to hold millions of records of data. There was very little, nearly none,
                  optimization at the time I was given it.<br /><br /> My initial task was to decide which database
                  would best fit the component that I was working. In order to do this, I decided to scale and test
                  three different databases: MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and Cassandra. <br /><br />The difference in all three
                  query exeuction times showed Cassandra as the slowest, MongoDB in second place, and PostgreSQL in the
                  first with a 6ms difference between Cassandra and PostgreSQL. <br /><br /> To ensure that PostgreSQL
                  would perform properly under extreme conditions, I implemented k6 and used New Relic to analyze its
                  performance. At first, the performance was very poor because all of my data was stored in a single
                  table. In order to improve this, I vertically partitioned the database to break the single table up
                  into 6 tables which solved the poor performance.<br /><br />A further optimization that would have
                  improved the performance even more would have been implementing a load-balancer in order to
                  efficiently distribute the workload. </p>

                <p>An application built between a team of four developers who collaborated to create and test different
                  modules to create a single working site.<br /><br />Each member in our team created a specific module
                  to build and test in order to bring them all together to create what you see on the left. By using
                  Agile Methodology, we were able to request for and provide code reviews, provide assistance to each
                  other, and consistently meet product deadlines. <br /><br />The biggest challenge for us was bringing
                  in all four modules together to render a functional site and creating a test-driven development. By
                  keeping each other updated through stand-ups and Trello, we set deadlines for ourselves to create and
                  pass a certain number of tests using Jest and Enzyme. Additionally, another big challenge came from
                  our styling formats. When we brought all of our components together through a proxy server, our styles
                  were conflicting with each other because of the lack of specificity in our class names and some
                  members were using styled components which required an additional configuration. Luckily, we were able
                  to get past this quickly by specifying our class names to correspond to our respective styles.
                  <br /><br />My specific role for this application was to create a photo carousel from scratch with
                  modals for each image. A technical challenge that I ran into while working on my module was getting
                  text to appear on each of the modal images. It gave me an error that stated that paragraph tags cannot
                  appear with an image. Thankfully, it wasn't an issue that took me days to figure out. I ended up
                  changing my paragraph tags into heading tags which worked even better because the text were specific
                  descriptions of each image and film.</p>

                <p>An application designed to be a online journal for my client to write blogs about their thoughts,
                  ideas, and views.<p>
                    <p>This application focused more on frontend development using React and SCSS, while, also, required
                      backend development in order to save, retrieve, and delete blog posts. My client is able to view
                      all of
                      their posts in two pages, the home page, which also displays a photo of their choosing, and the
                      'All' page where only blog posts are displayed. <br /><br /> The home page was a simple set up
                      which just required an
                      initial GET request from the server to retrieve the blogs and display them; however, the blogs
                      were designed to only show a small portion of itself. This was designed in order to reduce the
                      space for each blog. In addition to that, the home page requires
                      two Link components from React Router. The first occurrence of the Link component directs the user
                      to the 'All' page. My client can also view each blog with its full content in a different page
                      which is the second occurrence of the Link component directs the user to the 'Blog'
                      page which displays the full version of the blog chosen. <br /><br /> This application also
                      utilizes the POST and DELETE request by letting my client create new blog posts and delete them.
                      Once they go to the 'All' page, they are shown a create button, another Link component, which
                      takes them to the 'Create' page where they add the title, date, and the message. Once they finish
                      the blog, they submit the blog which takes them to the home page and they can view their newly
                      created blog there or in the 'All' page. If they want to delete a blog, they can simply view the
                      full blog which displays a delete button, another Link component. Once clicked on, the request
                      will be sent to the server, and they will be directed to the home page.</p>
